## Overview [(Project Outline Document)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O15rZwOUWx5OShmKMclxYovVb08hVXd-oJIIahe3J5E/edit?usp=sharing)
CanCode is a powerful educational platform for students and educators to aid in understanding computer science principles.

Our website enables students to learn in a new way that is hard to replicate anywhere else. Students can learn at their own pace, how they want to learn or can complete with others to flourish together. CanCode is expected to revolutionize the way people learn to code. Utilizing tools such as highly customized and simplified coding problems, educational articles, and an in-built chat platform, CanCode is a perfect platform to level up your learning.

******************************************************************************************************************************************************

## Our Purpose:
They idea for CanCode was spawned from a lack of any service really like it. Services such as LeetCode provide problems far too advanced for beginners, however, platforms such as Scratch and Code.org are too easy. There exists no high-profile and efficient product for this intermediate period in a programmer's journey to continue guided learning other than through schooling. CanCode aims to fill that gap and provide highly refined and streamlined learning methods which can mend the gap from a true beginner programmer to someone proficient in the coding fundamentals.

## Project Key Goals
The following bullets are goals we are trying to achieve:

- Ease and accessibility
  - Making an account should be very easy. Link your GitHub, Google, or a simple Email/Password

- Education
  - Everything on CanCode is present to further the education of users and assist in their learning
  - CanCode will lead the industry in teaching intermediate level coding skills

- Usabilty
  - Anyone who is trying to learn intermediate coding skills in any language should be able to with CanCode

- Fun!
  - CanCode should be very fun. User engagment is a top priority

- Maintainability
  - CanCode is built with good practices in mind to allow for a thriving and healthy platform for the future

## Project History:
This project began early January 2023 at Del Norte High School. CanCode is written in JS using React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Firebase and Express.js. CanCode takes inspiraton from many platforms: LeetCode, W3Schools, Khan Academy, Slack and other similiar platforms.
